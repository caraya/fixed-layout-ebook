    <p>There's something so facinating about signposts. </p>

    <p>They point in new and misterious directions. </p>

    <p>They point to where you've been and where you will go.</p>

    <p>They challenge certainties and they stimulate curiosity.</p>

      <p><strong><em>I remember seeing this last year in Portland and being totally amazed, and a little intimidated by it. I went back to the hotel and started looking for all the places it mentioned and seeing where they were and how could I get there.</em></strong></p>
